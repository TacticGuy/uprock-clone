**UpRock Clone**

This is a simple clone of the UpRock website UI that I built for practice. I wanted to try and recreate their landing page design to get better at frontend development and styling.
---
🚀 Features
-> Responsive landing page design.
-> Clean and modern UI (trying to match the original).

Built with basic web technologies.
---
🛠️ Tech Stack
-> HTML5 - For the structure.
-> CSS3 - For the styling and layout.
-> JavaScript - For any basic interactions.
---
⚙️ Tooling & Config 
-> TypeScript — appears to be used (repo shows TypeScript config files).
-> Tailwind CSS — Tailwind configuration file is present (tailwind.confg.js).
-> Vite — For development server and build tooling (vite.config.ts).
-> Node/NPM — Managed by package.json (likely used for Tailwind + Vite).
---
⚙️ How to run it
-> Download or clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/TacticGuy/uprock-clone.git
```
-> Go inside the project folder.
```
cd uprock-clone
```
-> Make sure you have Node.js (v14+) installed. Then run: 
```
npm install
```
-> This installs all required packages like Vite, Tailwind, etc.
-> Start the dev server
```
npm run dev
```
-> That will start a local development server.
-> Open this in your browser to see the webpage.
```
http://localhost:3000
```
-> If you want a production build, run:
```
npm run build
```
-> After building, you can preview:
```
npm run preview
```

📝 Learning Notes
-> This project uses Vite as the dev tool + bundler.
-> Tailwind CSS handles styling.
-> You’ll need Node.js & npm installed first.
