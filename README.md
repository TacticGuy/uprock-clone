UpRock Clone
This is a simple clone of the UpRock website UI that I built for practice. I wanted to try and recreate their landing page design to get better at frontend development and styling.

🚀 Features
Responsive landing page design.

Clean and modern UI (trying to match the original).

Built with basic web technologies.

🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5 - For the structure.

CSS3 - For the styling and layout.

JavaScript - For any basic interactions.

📸 Screenshots
(You can add a screenshot of your project here later)

⚙️ How to run it
Download or clone the repo:
```
Bash

git clone https://github.com/TacticGuy/uprock-clone.git
```
Open the folder.

Just double-click the index.html file to see it in your browser.

📝 Learning Notes
This was a cool project to work on because I learned more about:

How to layout complex sections using Flexbox/Grid.

Making sure the site doesn't break on mobile screens.

Matching colors and fonts from a real-world site.
